- BankingInvestment is a light C++ project (developed in Visual Studio) to fulfill assignment requirements, namely simulating simple interest rate calculations.
- A particular strength of this project is it's modularity through an object-oriented approach. This project could be easily extended with more simulation parameters.
- A future todo would be creating visual representations of numeric data, such as optional graphs
- Input validation was a common and significant hurdle. The InputValidation class has simple and lightweight solutions to validating input to certain data types.
- In particular, the concise and clean program flow from this project is a feature I would like present in every piece of software I author.
- In-line and block comments, naming conventions, and encapsulation make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
